<p>Many people reacted to the announcement by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support">microsoft</a> to stop support for IE on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2022/06/15/browser-history-twitter-reacts-to-microsoft-ending-support-for-internet-explorer/">twitter</a> recently. It felt nostalgic for me too.</p>
<p>I first started using a PC around 1998-99. I was in 6th grade maybe. As far as I could remember, it had Samsung samtron CRT monitor, a CPU with some intel processor, 40 GB IDE hard disk and a Dax make dial-up modem connected to PCI card.</p>
