      <description>My homelab was running on a single dell r210. It had pfsense and few VMs, all the self-hosted apps were deployed using docker. Things were running fine for more than a year but i was missing high-availability, since i had only one server. I wanted my services to be available always! To achieve high availability on proxmox you need 3 servers minimum. Thus the hunt for 2 more began!
Hardware Upgrades Many say olx is a bad place and full of scammers.</description>

      <description>HTTPS for Homelab When I wanted to install bitwarden_rs (now vaultwarden), i read their wiki and got struck with an idea to setup my homelab apps behind https.
Then the hunt for reverse proxies started and i settled down with caddy after trying out nginx and traefik (both are good, but not suitable for my usecase). Caddy is a simple configurable reverse proxy and webserver. I use it as reverse proxy and HTTPS provider for all my homelab apps.</description>

      <description>Intro ping 127.0.0.1
There are some interests which do not change! I used to write html and css in college days. I have had shared hosting accounts, VPS and so on! I still remember creating a small site for college workshop using WordPress. I learnt web development and managing VPS through youtube. I have always wanted to host on my own server and somehow have managed to do it this year.</description>
